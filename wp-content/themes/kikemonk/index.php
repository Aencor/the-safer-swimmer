            <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to The Safer Swimmer</h1>
            <p class="lead">The Safer Swimmer was founded in 2023 as the formal parent company of Premier Aquatics, uniting a dedicated management team to oversee operations, HR, marketing, finance, and executive leadership.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 2011, Dan Berzansky founded Premier Recreation Services as a full-service aquatic and recreation programming company. In its firs year, Premier Recreation Services began with two contracts—Emerald Bay Community Association and the City of Aliso Viejo—offering summer camp programming, after-school activities, event planning, lifeguard services, swim lessons, and swim team programs.</p>
            <p class="lead">By 2014, Premier Recreation Services had experienced rapid growth in the aquatics space, expanding to serve 10 contracts throughout Orange County. In 2015, we streamlined our focus to aquatic services, leading to a pivotal rebrand. Premier Recreation Services officially became Premier Aquatic Services (Premier Aquatics), specializing solely in aquatics. That same year, we launched Premier Health and Safety, offering training programs for both private individuals and public organizations.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 2019, Premier Aquatics took another exciting step forward, breaking ground on its first indoor swim school. Premier Swim Academy opened its doors in Rancho Cucamonga in July 2020, followed by a second location in Diamond Bar, CA, in early 2023, after converting the former Maple Hill YMCA into a state-of-the-art swim school.</p>
            <p class="lead">Today, Premier Aquatics continues to expand, managing over 40 contracts and staffing nearly 100 locations across Arizona, California, and Utah. At The Safer Swimmer, we remain dedicated to delivering exceptional aquatic services, promoting safety, education, and a lifelong love of swimming in every community we serve.</p>
